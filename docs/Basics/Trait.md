In this tutorial, we will learn about what is Traits, what are different types, how to create them and rotate different cube from different traits.

`Trait` is conecpt in `Iron` means a piece of logic attached to object or scene.

There are 4 different types of `traits`:
1. **Haxe Trait**: [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) Text-based scripting trait that can be used to write game-play logic in.

2. **Logic Nodes Trait**: Visual scripting trait for writing game-play logic in. It is similar to [UE4's Blueprints](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Blueprints/index.html).

3. **Canvas Trait**: Trait for UI, canvas can be made using [Armory2D](https://github.com/armory3d/armory2d), but since it use `Json`, you can create layout yourself without `Armory2D`.

4. **WebAssembly(WASM)**: [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) can also be used as scripting trait, It can be written in [`Rust`](https://www.rust-lang.org/)/[`C`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29)/[`C++`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B) and than complied to `WASM` to use it in Armory *(WASM will only work with Krom target)*.
WASM is very useful when it comes to plugins, you can use Libraries made in `Rust`/`C`/`C++` and compile it to WASM and then use it in `Armory` and `Kha`. Two examples that are used in `ArmorPaint`: [Texture-synthesis(Rust)](https://twitter.com/luboslenco/status/1173942414966439938), [Chips(C)](https://twitter.com/luboslenco/status/1172536139573538816).

Let's get started, fire up armory3D project.
We will create Trait in following order:

1. [Haxe](#haxe)
2. [Logic Node](#logic-node)
3. [Wasm](#wasm)
4. [Canvas](#canvas)

## Haxe
Create a cube, name it `Haxe` and place it wherever you want. Select it and go to `Scene - Armory Scene Trait`.

1. Click `+`, select `Haxe` and click `OK`, `Haxe` trait placeholder should appear.
2. Click `New Script` and name the script of your choice, just make sure the first letter is capital(`HaxeScript` for me).
3. Finally hit `Edit Script`, you system default IDE should now open up with the project.

Edit the script:
```haxe
// In HaxeScript.hx
package arm;

//Imports
import iron.object.Object;
import iron.math.Vec4;
import iron.Scene;

class HaxeScript extends iron.Trait {
	//Initialise haxeCube as Object
	var haxeCube:Object;

	public function new() {
		super();
		//NotifyOnInit function get excuted when the 'trait' is initiated.
		notifyOnInit(function() {
			//Get haxeCube Object from active Scene.
			haxeCube = Scene.active.getChild("Haxe");
		});

		//NotifyOnUpdate function get excuted every frame.
		notifyOnUpdate(function() {
			//Rotate haxeCube with Vec4(x, y, z) and speed.
			haxeCube.transform.rotate(new Vec4(0.0, 0.0, 1.0), 0.01);
		});
	}
}
```

Now, if you were to play it, you should see `Haxe` cube rotating!.

## Logic Node
Create a cube, name it `Nodes` and place it wherever you want. Select it and go to `Scene - Armory Scene Trait`.

1. Click `+`, select `Nodes` and click `OK`, `Nodes` trait placeholder should appear.
2. Change your editor type to `Logic Node Editor` and click `+New`.
3. A node tree should be created, you can rename it by editing the text field(`LogicNodes` for me).
4. Go back to `Scene - Armory Scene trait`, select you logic nodes place holder and click `Tree`, select `LogicNodes` in dropdown.

and now add following nodes(`Shift + A`):

![](/../../docassets/traits_1.png ':size=500')

1. On Update: It is triggered every tick.
2. Rotate object on axis, speed is set directly in vector.

Now if you play it, `Nodes` cube should start spinnig.

## Wasm
Create a cube, name it `Wasm` and place it wherever you want. Select it and go to `Scene - Armory Scene Trait`.

1. Click `+`, select `Wasm` and click `OK`, `Wasm` trait placeholder should appear.
2. Click `New Module`, and it should re-direct you to [WebAssembly Studio](https://webassembly.studio/), select `Empty Rust Project`(you can select c/c++ too) and click `Create`.
3. Enter `Rust`/`C`/`C++` code and click `Build` and there should be `main.wasm` in `out` folder, right-click and download it.
4. Put outputed `main.wasm` in `Bundled` folder (create one, if there is no bundled folder).
5. Go back to `Scene - Armory Scene Trait`, select previously created `Wasm` placeholder, click `Refresh` and select `main` in `Module` dropdown.

```rust
// Rust example of rotating cube
// main.rs
extern {
	fn notify_on_update(f: extern fn() -> ()) -> ();
	fn get_object(name: *const i8) -> i32;
	fn set_transform(object: i32, x: f32, y: f32, z: f32, rx: f32, ry: f32, rz: f32, sx: f32, sy: f32, sz: f32) -> ();
}

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn update() -> () {
	unsafe {
		let name = std::ffi::CString::new("Wasm").unwrap();
		let object = get_object(name.as_ptr());
		static mut rot: f32 = 0.1;
		rot += 0.01;
		set_transform(object, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, rot, 0.5, 0.5, 0.5);
	}
}

#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn main() -> i32 {
	unsafe {
		notify_on_update(update);
	}
	return 0;
}
```

Now if you play it then you should have spinny rusty wasm cube.

## Canvas
1. Click `+`, select `UI` and click `OK`, `Canvas` trait placeholder should appear.
2. Click `New Canvas` and enter the name and click `Edit Canvas`.
3. Add `Text` element and set text as `Hello World from Canvas!` and save it.

If you play it now, you should see `Hello World from Canvas`.
