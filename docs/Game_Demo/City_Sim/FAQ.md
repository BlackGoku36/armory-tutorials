    <summary>WHY TUTORIAL FOR CBS GAME, NOT FPS OR SOMETHING ELSE?</summary>

You might be wondering, why tutorial for CBS game in particular and not something like FPS game? Well, that because of following reasons:
- **Boringgggg!!!**: FPS game tutorial are really common type of tutorial among game dev community, I mean there already exists video and text tutorial for `Armory3D` game engine. so, I find it boring to create another one.
- **Unique**: Tutorial for CBS game are rare, some people might be wondering about how it work inside, so I thought why not.

- **Simple**: Small CBS game are simple enough to make and understand.
