    <summary>YOUR TUTORIALS ARE GOOD! MIND IF I TRANSLATE IT TO OTHER LANGUAGE?</summary>

Yes, you can translate it to whatever language you want, whether it is `Gujarati`, `Hindi`, `Japanese`, `Portuguese`, or even `MC enchanting table language`, feel free to do so. The only thing you gotta do is credit me and not claim yourself as original author, other than that, you are good.
